deoplete_swift.txt* Swift completion plugin for deoplete

This plugin will add Swift completion entries to
deoplete(https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim). Since the plugin uses
sourcekitten (https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten) in order to obtain the
completion entries, it is necessary to install it.

Global options:                                  *deoplete_swift-global-options*

                                                          *'deoplete_swift_sdk'*
Type: string
Default: ''
Use this option to specify the full path to the SDK you would like to use. If
left empty, the default SDK (MacOS or PC) of the system will be used.
Example: >
    let g:deoplete_swift_sdk =
    '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS9.0.sdk'
<

                                                       *'deoplete_swift_target'*
Type: string
Default: ''
Use this option to specify the compilation target. If left empty, the default
target arch of the system will be used.
Examples: >
    let g:deoplete_swift_target = 'arm64-apple-ios9.0' " iOS
    let g:deoplete_swift_target = 'x86_64-apple-darwin16.6.0' " MacOS
<

                                                   *'deoplete_swift_spm_module'*
Type: string
Default: ''
Use this option to specify the name of a swift package manager module, in
order to let sourcekitten read the flags from it. If left empty, it will be
ignored.
WARNING! This option has not been tested yet!
Example: >
    let g:deoplete_swift_spm_module = 'Module name'
<

Each one these options have their local equivalents:
|'b:deoplete_swift_sdk'|
|'b:deoplete_swift_target'|
|'b:deoplete_swift_spm_module'|
This variables take precedence over the global ones.


Mappings:                                        *deoplete_swift-global-options*

You can map the keys in order to jump to a placeholder create by a snippet
plugin:
Example:
>
    autocmd FileType swift nmap <buffer> <C-k> <Plug>(deoplete_swift_jump_to_placeholder)
    autocmd FileType swift imap <buffer> <C-k> <Plug>(deoplete_swift_jump_to_placeholder)
